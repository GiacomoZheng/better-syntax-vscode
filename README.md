## Requirements

For use of the LaTeX, please use it with the help of [`james-yu.latex-workshop`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=james-yu.latex-workshop).

## Recommendation

[bracket-pair-colorizer-2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2) is a beautiful and powerful extension and it support most of languages. You can directly use it after intalling.

[Better Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments) is also a useful extension.
<!-- , but it (2.0.2) doesn't support gm directly. In the latest version of `gm` (`1.0.5`), I build in the function of the `better comments` into the sytnax, with the help of some other configurations. -->

## Release Notes

Go to [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for details.
